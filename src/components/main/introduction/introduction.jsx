        I was a relatively average Nigerian student frustrated with the
        occasional ASSU strike
      </p>
      <p>
        All I wanted was to be able to afford things without solely depending on
        my allowance which wasn&apos;t worth much
      </p>
      <p>
        Around the same time, the whole &lsquo;make money online&lsquo; trend
        started to gain traction. Needless to say, I fell victim to a lot of
        ponzi schemes all in the name of wanting to be financially free. I got
        scammed out of the little I use to get by

        Until a friend introduced me to Amazon KDP, that came in clutch as I had
        a complete nervous breakdown
      </p>
      <p>
        Call it what you want, I made up my mind to familiarize myself with
        publishing and earning through Amazon KDP
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially, all I thought Amazon KDP was good for was supplementing ones
        income, not more than â‚¦20k per month. But, news got to me that people
        pay rent/mortgage, buy cars, etc with Kindle Direct Publishing alone, I
        was hooked
